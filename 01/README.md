See farm folder.  Here the recommended way to start working on this:

```
alex@latitude:~$ cd Projects/RESTing-with-Flask
RESTing-with-Flask/      RESTing-with-Flask.wiki/ 
alex@latitude:~$ cd Projects/RESTing-with-Flask
alex@latitude:~/Projects/RESTing-with-Flask$ cd 01
alex@latitude:~/Projects/RESTing-with-Flask/01$ code .
alex@latitude:~/Projects/RESTing-with-Flask/01$ 

```

Then explore the farm folder.
