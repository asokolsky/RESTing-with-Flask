Simple and not so simple REST services done in Python and Flask.

These are the sources.  See also
[RESTing with Flask Wiki](https://github.com/asokolsky/RESTing-with-Flask/wiki)

This is a work in progress.
Developed and tested on Linux.
But should run pretty much anywhere, although if you do not have bash,
you will have to jump through more hoops.

## How to use it

Open folder [00.prerequisites](00.prerequisites).
Read the details on the prerequisites and how to start the development.

Then go to the next folder, [01.flask](01.flask).

Keep doing it until you learn all there is to learn.
