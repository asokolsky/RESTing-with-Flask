# Starting with REST

What we had before can not be truly considered a REST server. REST servers
operate on collections and we had none of these.  In this section we shall
build one.

Start with https://restfulapi.net/  Overall it is a good summary of the best
practices.  In this seciton we will make at least one deviation from those, so
be on a look out.

Review [some examples](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/3432056-build-your-web-projects-with-rest-apis/3496011-identify-examples-of-rest-apis):

* [Gmail API](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/3432056-build-your-web-projects-with-rest-apis/3496011-identify-examples-of-rest-apis)

Then read [Farm.API.v01.md](Farm.API.v01.md) for a proposal.
I am not a farming domain expert.
But for my purposes at this stage such an API will do the job of
demonstrating the craft of building a REST server.

Then, proceed to the [farm folder](farm/).
