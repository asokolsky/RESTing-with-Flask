# Starting with REST

What we had before can not be truly considered REST server.  In this section we
shall build one. REST servers operate on collections.

Study https://restfulapi.net/  Overall it is a good summary of the best
practices.  In this seciton we will make at least one deviation from those, so
be on a look out.

Then read Farm.API.v01.md for a proposal.  I am not a farming domain expert. But
for my purposes at this stage such an API should do the job of demonstrating the
craft of building a REST server.
